# ESLint Experience

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The semi rule enforces the consistent use of semicolons. It was introduced in ESLint v0.0.6. It’s made for people who want to enforce semicolon usage (or omission) in any particular way. It’s important because JavaScript has a controversial feature known as automatic semicolon insertion (ASI). This feature causes JavaScript to automatically place semicolons in what it considers the right place. This can lead to errors where JavaScript misinterprets where the semicolon is supposed to go and lead to further problems. Having this rule can help prevent that error.
